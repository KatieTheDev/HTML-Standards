# HTML-Standards
A list of HTML coding standards I will use. This will be updated over time and will be used in future projects, and current projects created before these standards will be updated to match these.

## Page Structure
Each page will be structured with a seperate `<head>` and `<body>` tag that will be used to seperate out the page header from the rest of the page. When using Bootstrap, the page header will always be put inside its own `.container` or `.container-fluid`.

When using Bootstrap, all body content will also be inside a `.container` or `.container-fluid`. This can have further `.container`s or `.container-fluid`s, depending on the needs of the page.

## Page Header
Every page header inside a `<head>` will have the classes `.container` or `.container-fluid` as well as `.page-header`.
